# Java
Java coding. 

The GUI files were first written in Jun 2017 when I was exploring some Java and UI. The CodeWars solutions and everything else is from June 2018.

Java problem solving will be the focus, and this will generally (if not completely) revolve around CodeWars problems and their solutions, however the goal is to get familiar and comfortable with Java, and also keeping in mind software engineering best practices (for example things like seperating classes from run/launcher programs).
